  <p class="howworks-description">
    I follow a three-step process for every commission:
  </p>

  <ol class="howworks-list">
    <li class="howworks-list_item">1. <span class="accent">Sketch:</span> Iâ€™ll send you the initial draft for approval.</li>
    <li class="howworks-list_item">2. <span class="accent">Base Colors:</span> A colored version without final details.</li>
    <li class="howworks-list_item">3. <span class="accent">Final Version:</span> The completed, polished artwork.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="howworks-description">
    You can request up to three changes during the process (e.g., in the sketch
    and base color stages). To make the most of these, please provide all
    necessary references and details upfront.
  </p>

  <p class="howworks-description">
    <span class="accent">Important</span>: Major changes (e.g., adding a new character) wonâ€™t be accepted
    during the final stage, so be sure everything is approved in the earlier
    steps.
